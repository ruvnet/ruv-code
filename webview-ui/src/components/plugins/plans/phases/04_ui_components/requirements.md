# Phase 4: UI Components - Requirements

## Functional Requirements

1. **Plugin List Component**
   - Display all installed plugins in a list format
   - Show plugin name, description, and enabled status for each entry
   - Include visual indicators for plugin type (local vs remote)
   - Provide toggle controls to enable/disable plugins
   - Include action buttons for edit, delete, and run operations
   - Handle empty state (no plugins installed)
   - Support keyboard navigation between list items

2. **Plugin Wizard Component**
   - Provide a step-by-step interface for creating new plugins
   - Support both local and remote plugin creation
   - Validate plugin inputs (slug uniqueness, required fields)
   - Offer field suggestions and guidance
   - Support both creation and editing modes
   - Handle form submission and cancellation
   - Provide clear error feedback

3. **Plugin Settings Panel**
   - Integrate plugin management into the settings view
   - Include section header and description
   - Position plugin management appropriately in the settings hierarchy
   - Include "Add Plugin" button to launch the wizard
   - Provide responsive layout for different screen sizes
   - Show plugin list within the settings context

4. **Plugin Details Component**
   - Show expanded details for a selected plugin
   - Display full role definition and custom instructions
   - Show technical details (package name, path, groups)
   - Provide collapsible/expandable interface for space management
   - Format content appropriately for readability

5. **Plugin Execution Feedback**
   - Display plugin execution results to the user
   - Show loading state during execution
   - Format output appropriately (including potential code blocks)
   - Handle and display execution errors clearly
   - Provide option to copy output to clipboard

6. **Error Handling UI**
   - Display validation errors in context
   - Show operation errors (add/remove/toggle/run) with clear messaging
   - Provide retry options where appropriate
   - Ensure error states don't block the UI
   - Include detailed error information when available

7. **UI State Management**
   - Handle plugin state updates from extension
   - Update UI in response to plugin changes
   - Maintain consistent UI state with underlying plugin system
   - Support optimistic updates for better user experience
   - Handle asynchronous operations gracefully

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Render plugin list efficiently even with many items
   - Optimize state updates to prevent unnecessary renders
   - Ensure responsive UI during plugin operations
   - Minimize performance impact on the main extension

2. **Usability**
   - Follow VS Code design patterns and UI conventions
   - Provide familiar interaction patterns
   - Ensure accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
   - Support internationalization (i18n)
   - Include appropriate tooltips and helper text

3. **Maintainability**
   - Use consistent component structure
   - Follow React best practices
   - Include PropTypes or TypeScript types
   - Document component APIs
   - Separate UI logic from state management

4. **Testability**
   - Support unit testing of individual components
   - Allow easy mocking of extension communication
   - Include test coverage for key UI paths
   - Support integration testing of the complete UI flow

## Constraints

1. **VS Code UI Integration**
   - Must use VS Code webview UI toolkit components where appropriate
   - Must follow VS Code design language and patterns
   - Must support VS Code themes (light/dark/high contrast)
   - Must work within the constraints of the webview environment

2. **Extension Communication**
   - Must communicate with the extension through message passing
   - Must handle asynchronous operations and potential failures
   - Must maintain state consistency with the extension backend

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can view a list of all installed plugins with their status
2. Users can enable/disable plugins through toggle controls
3. Users can add new plugins through the wizard interface
4. Users can create both local and remote plugins
5. Users can edit existing plugin details
6. Users can remove plugins from the system
7. Users can run plugins and see execution results
8. All form inputs are properly validated with clear error messages
9. The UI maintains consistency with the extension state
10. The UI follows VS Code design patterns and accessibility standards
11. The UI components are responsive to different screen sizes
12. The UI handles all common error cases gracefully
