# Phase 3: Extension Integration - Requirements

## Functional Requirements

1. **ClineProvider Integration**
   - Integrate the `PluginManager` into the `ClineProvider` class
   - Initialize the plugin manager when the extension activates
   - Pass the VS Code extension context to the plugin manager
   - Provide a callback to update the UI when plugin state changes
   - Include plugins in the state sent to the webview

2. **Extension State Management**
   - Update the `ExtensionState` interface to include plugin data
   - Add plugins to the state sent to the webview
   - Ensure the webview receives plugin updates in real-time
   - Handle state synchronization between extension and webview

3. **Message Handling**
   - Add message handlers for plugin-related actions:
     - Add plugin 
     - Remove plugin
     - Toggle plugin enabled state
     - Update plugin properties
     - Execute plugin
   - Process messages from webview to perform plugin operations

4. **Command Registration**
   - Register VS Code commands for plugin operations:
     - Reload plugins
     - Open plugin manifest
     - Execute plugin from command palette
   - Connect commands to the plugin manager operations

5. **Extension Activation**
   - Initialize plugin system during extension activation
   - Set up plugin manager before webview is created
   - Ensure plugin system is ready when webview is first shown

6. **JSON Schema Support**
   - Add JSON schema for `.rooplugins` file
   - Register schema in `package.json` with VS Code JSON validation
   - Enable IntelliSense for editing plugin manifest files

7. **Package Updates**
   - Update `package.json` to include new commands
   - Add activation events for plugin-related commands
   - Include schema file in extension package
   - Update contribution points for plugin features

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Minimize impact on extension activation time
   - Ensure efficient state synchronization between extension and webview
   - Optimize message handling for plugin operations

2. **Error Handling**
   - Provide clear error messages for plugin operation failures
   - Present errors to user via VS Code notification system
   - Log errors with appropriate detail for debugging

3. **Security**
   - Validate all input from webview before processing
   - Sanitize plugin inputs before execution
   - Ensure proper permissions for file operations

4. **Maintainability**
   - Follow existing extension architecture patterns
   - Keep message handling code organized and modular
   - Provide clear interface boundaries between components

## Constraints

1. **VS Code API**
   - Use VS Code API for commands and extension operations
   - Follow VS Code extension best practices
   - Maintain compatibility with VS Code extension lifecycle

2. **Extension Architecture**
   - Maintain separation of concerns between components
   - Integrate with existing extension state management
   - Follow established message passing patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The `PluginManager` is correctly integrated into `ClineProvider`
2. Plugin data is included in the extension state sent to webview
3. The webview receives real-time updates when plugin state changes
4. All plugin-related messages from webview are handled correctly
5. VS Code commands for plugin operations are registered and functional
6. JSON schema for `.rooplugins` file is registered and working
7. `package.json` is updated with all required contributions
8. Plugin operations (add, remove, toggle, execute) work end-to-end
9. Errors are properly handled and communicated to the user
10. The integration follows established architectural patterns
