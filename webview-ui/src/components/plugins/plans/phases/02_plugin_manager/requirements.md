# Phase 2: Plugin Manager - Requirements

## Functional Requirements

1. **Plugin Manifest Management**
   - Create a `PluginManager` class to handle plugin manifest file operations
   - Provide methods to get, load, and save the plugin manifest
   - Support finding and validating the `.rooplugins` file in the workspace
   - Create a default empty manifest if none exists

2. **File Watching**
   - Watch the `.rooplugins` file for changes (create, modify, delete)
   - Automatically reload plugin list when manifest changes are detected
   - Notify interested components when plugin list changes (via callback)
   - Handle file deletion by recreating a default empty manifest

3. **Plugin CRUD Operations**
   - Add new plugins to the manifest
   - Remove existing plugins by slug
   - Update plugin properties (rename, change location, etc.)
   - Toggle plugin enabled state
   - Ensure all operations validate plugin entries before saving

4. **Plugin Execution**
   - Execute plugins via NPX (for remote plugins) or Node (for local plugins)
   - Support passing input to plugins and capturing output
   - Handle plugin execution errors gracefully
   - Validate plugin is enabled before execution
   - Support lifecycle (start, stop) for persistent plugins

5. **Plugin State Management**
   - Track running plugin processes
   - Support clean termination of running plugin processes
   - Handle errors during plugin execution
   - Provide observers/callbacks for plugin lifecycle events

6. **Local Plugin File Handling**
   - Create scaffold files for new local plugins
   - Support basic template for Hello World plugin
   - Validate local plugin file existence before execution

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Minimize overhead when executing plugins
   - Use efficient file watching mechanisms (debounce changes)
   - Implement write queue to prevent race conditions

2. **Error Handling**
   - Provide detailed error messages for plugin execution failures
   - Log errors in plugin loading and execution
   - Recover gracefully from failed plugin executions
   - Handle malformed manifest files with clear error messages

3. **Security**
   - Sandbox plugin execution to prevent interference with extension
   - Validate plugin inputs and sanitize paths
   - Handle potentially dangerous operations safely

4. **Extensibility**
   - Design for future extension of plugin capabilities
   - Allow for different plugin execution strategies
   - Support plugin versioning

## Constraints

1. **VS Code Extension API**
   - Use VS Code API for file operations and process execution
   - Ensure compatibility with VS Code's sandboxing model
   - Follow VS Code extension best practices

2. **Interoperability**
   - Maintain consistent behavior between UI and command line operations
   - Ensure compatibility with existing Roo Code patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The `PluginManager` class is implemented with all required functionality
2. File watching correctly detects changes to `.rooplugins` file
3. CRUD operations correctly modify the manifest
4. Remote plugins can be executed via NPX successfully
5. Local plugins can be executed via Node successfully
6. Plugin output is correctly captured and returned
7. Plugin execution errors are properly handled and reported
8. Local plugin templates are created correctly
9. All operations validate inputs and provide appropriate error messages
10. Test suite covers all primary functionality
