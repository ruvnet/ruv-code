# Phase 5: End-to-end Tests - Requirements

## Overview

End-to-end (E2E) testing is the final phase of our plugin system implementation, ensuring all components work together correctly. These tests validate the complete user workflows and interaction between the frontend UI, extension background services, and the file system.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Plugin Creation Workflow**
   - Test complete workflow for creating local plugins
   - Test complete workflow for creating remote plugins
   - Verify plugin manifest file is correctly created with expected content
   - Validate proper error handling for invalid inputs

2. **Plugin Management Workflows**
   - Test enabling and disabling plugins
   - Test editing existing plugins
   - Test removing plugins
   - Verify changes persist after reloading VSCode

3. **Plugin Execution Workflow**
   - Test plugin execution from UI
   - Verify execution results display correctly
   - Test execution of plugins with different permission groups
   - Validate error handling for failed executions

4. **Cross-component Integration**
   - Verify UI component updates reflect backend state changes
   - Test file-system watcher functionality for external plugin changes
   - Verify extension activation loads existing plugins correctly
   - Test message passing between webview and extension host

5. **Startup and Initialization**
   - Verify plugin system initializes correctly on VSCode startup
   - Test plugin loading sequence and priority handling
   - Verify plugin settings persistence between sessions
   - Test migration handling for potential manifest format changes

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Load time for plugin list should be under 500ms
   - Plugin execution should provide feedback within 100ms of initiation
   - UI should remain responsive during plugin operations
   - File system operations should be non-blocking

2. **Reliability**
   - System should gracefully handle and recover from unexpected plugin failures
   - Changes to plugins should be atomic and never leave the system in an inconsistent state
   - Plugin operations should be resilient to VSCode window/project reloads

3. **Usability**
   - End-to-end flows should follow intuitive paths with clear feedback
   - Error messages should be descriptive and actionable
   - Status indicators should accurately reflect system state

4. **Compatibility**
   - Test compatibility across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Verify functionality in remote development environments
   - Test with various VSCode versions within supported range

## Test Environment Requirements

1. **Test Fixtures**
   - Sample local plugins for testing
   - Mock remote packages for testing
   - Test scripts to automate user interactions
   - Reset utilities to ensure clean test environment

2. **Isolation Requirements**
   - Tests should not interfere with user's actual plugin configurations
   - Each test should run in an isolated environment
   - Test cleanup should restore system to original state

3. **Tooling Requirements**
   - Automated UI testing infrastructure
   - Ability to mock VSCode extension API when needed
   - Screenshots or video capture for UI test failures
   - Reporting mechanism for test results

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All E2E test cases pass consistently across multiple test runs
2. Plugin creation, editing, removal, and execution workflows function as expected
3. UI components accurately reflect the state of the plugin system
4. System gracefully handles edge cases and error conditions
5. Performance meets defined targets for responsiveness
6. System properly persists state between VSCode sessions
7. End-to-end tests are automated and can be run as part of CI/CD pipeline
8. Tests are documented with clear steps, expected results, and screenshots
9. Test environment can be easily set up and torn down
10. All cross-component interactions successfully validate

## Test Data Requirements

1. Sample plugin manifests with various configurations
2. Edge case data to test validation boundaries
3. Large number of plugins to test performance with scale
4. Malformed plugin data to test error handling
5. Mock plugin execution results for predictable testing
