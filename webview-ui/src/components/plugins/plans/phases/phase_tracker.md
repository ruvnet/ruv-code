## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Schema & Interface Design

**Goal**: Define data structures, schemas, and interfaces for the plugin system.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Plugin entry interface definition
- Zod validation schema
- JSON schema for VS Code
- Extension and webview message types
- Tests for schema validation

**Test Criteria**:
- Schema correctly validates valid plugins
- Schema rejects invalid plugins
- Types are consistent between frontend and backend

### Phase 2: Plugin Manager Implementation

**Goal**: Implement the core backend component for managing plugins.

**Key Deliverables**:
- PluginManager class implementation
- File watching for hot reloading
- CRUD operations for plugins
- Plugin execution engine
- Unit tests for manager functionality

**Test Criteria**:
- Manager correctly loads and validates plugins
- File watcher detects changes to manifest
- Plugin operations (add, remove, toggle) work correctly
- Local and remote plugins execute as expected

### Phase 3: Extension Integration

**Goal**: Integrate the Plugin Manager with the rest of the extension.

**Key Deliverables**:
- WebviewMessageHandler extension
- Command registrations
- ClineProvider integration
- ExtensionState updates

**Test Criteria**:
- Messages from UI are correctly processed
- Commands can be executed from VS Code command palette
- State is correctly synchronized between extension and UI

### Phase 4: UI Component Development

**Goal**: Create the user interface components for the plugin system.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Plugin Settings component
- Installed Plugins list
- Plugin List Item component
- Plugin Wizard form
- Plugin Execution display
- UI tests

**Test Criteria**:
- Components render correctly
- User interactions trigger appropriate messages
- Forms validate inputs properly
- UI updates reflect backend state changes

### Phase 5: Testing & Integration

**Goal**: Ensure all components work together and meet requirements.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Integration tests
- End-to-end tests
- Edge case handling
- Performance optimization

**Test Criteria**:
- Full workflow tests pass
- Edge cases are handled gracefully
- Performance meets requirements
- All requirements are satisfied

### Phase 6: Hello World Example

**Goal**: Create example plugins to demonstrate the system's capabilities.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Local Hello World plugin
- Remote NPX Hello World plugin
- Documentation for creating plugins
- Tutorial for plugin development

**Test Criteria**:
- Examples run successfully
- Documentation is clear and comprehensive
- New plugins can be created following the tutorial

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| TBD | Use Zod for schema validation | Type safety and runtime validation |
| TBD | Store plugins in `.rooplugins` | Consistent with `.roomodes` pattern |
| TBD | Use NPX for remote plugins | Avoids permanent installation |
| TBD | Integrate with Settings panel | Consistent UI experience |

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| NPX execution performance | Medium | Medium | Implement caching or show loading state |
| Plugin crashes affecting extension | High | Low | Run in isolated processes |
| Schema changes breaking compatibility | Medium | Low | Version the schema, provide migration |
| UI integration complexity | Medium | Medium | Follow existing patterns, component tests |

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of Phase 1 (Schema & Interface Design)
2. Validate interfaces with stakeholders
3. Set up testing infrastructure
4. Proceed to Phase 2 upon completion of Phase 1

## Open Questions

- Should global plugins be supported across all workspaces?
- How should plugin versioning be handled?
- What security measures are needed beyond process isolation?
- How will plugins be discovered by users?
