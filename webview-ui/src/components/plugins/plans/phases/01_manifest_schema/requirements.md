# Phase 1: Plugin Manifest Schema - Requirements

## Functional Requirements

1. **Plugin Manifest File Format**
   - The system must support a `.rooplugins` JSON file at the workspace root
   - The manifest must contain a top-level "plugins" array with plugin entries
   - The manifest must follow a well-defined schema for validation

2. **Plugin Entry Required Fields**
   - `slug`: Unique identifier for the plugin (lowercase, no spaces)
   - `name`: Human-friendly display name
   - `location`: Either "local" or "remote" to distinguish source type
   - For location="remote": `package` field is required (NPM package name/path)
   - For location="local": `path` field is required (local script path)

3. **Plugin Entry Optional Fields**
   - `roleDefinition`: Description of the plugin's role/purpose/persona
   - `groups`: Array of capability groups/permissions the plugin needs
   - `customInstructions`: Additional guidance for using the plugin
   - `enabled`: Boolean flag to toggle plugin active state (default: true)

4. **Schema Validation**
   - The system must validate the manifest structure against the defined schema
   - Validation must enforce required fields based on plugin location
   - The system must provide clear error messages for invalid manifest formats
   - The schema must use Zod for type validation and TypeScript for type safety

5. **TypeScript Interface Definitions**
   - Create TypeScript interfaces for plugin entries and manifest structure
   - Define shared interfaces that can be used by both the extension and webview
   - Include JSDoc comments for each field to document purpose and constraints
   - Support TypeScript type inference for plugin location and required fields

6. **JSON Schema for Editor Support**
   - Provide a JSON schema definition for the `.rooplugins` file
   - Enable IntelliSense and validation in the VS Code editor
   - Include descriptions and examples in the schema for user guidance

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Schema validation must be efficient enough to handle manifest files with 50+ plugins
   - Type definitions must not impact runtime performance of the extension

2. **Maintainability**
   - Schema definitions must be centralized to avoid duplication
   - TypeScript types should be derived from the schema to ensure consistency
   - Follow naming conventions consistent with existing Roo Code patterns

3. **Extensibility**
   - The schema design must anticipate future expansions of plugin capabilities
   - Allow for versioning of the manifest schema for backward compatibility

## Constraints

1. **Compatibility**
   - Support VS Code's JSON schema association for `.rooplugins` files
   - Ensure compatibility with existing VS Code extension APIs
   - Follow patterns similar to other configuration files in Roo Code (like `.roomodes`)

2. **Security**
   - Validate input to prevent injection attacks or malformed configurations
   - Sanitize potentially unsafe inputs before processing

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A well-defined TypeScript interface for `RooPluginEntry` exists
2. A Zod schema for validating plugin manifest is implemented
3. JSON Schema for VS Code editor support is created
4. Test cases validate both valid and invalid manifest configurations
5. TypeScript types correctly enforce conditional requirements based on plugin location
6. Documentation is provided for each field in the schema
