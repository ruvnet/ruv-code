# Roo Code Plugin System - Requirements Specification

## 1. Overview

The Roo Code Plugin System will extend the main Roo Code VSCode extension with the ability to install, manage, and execute both local (file-based) and remote (NPX-based) plugins. The system will provide a user-friendly UI for managing plugins, support hot-reloading, and include a full example of a Hello World plugin for both local and remote scenarios.

## 2. User Stories

### As a Roo Code User

- I want to view all installed plugins so I can see what's available.
- I want to enable or disable plugins so I can control which ones are active.
- I want to run plugins directly from the UI so I can test their functionality.
- I want to remove plugins I no longer need so I can keep my environment clean.
- I want to see plugin execution results so I can understand what they do.

### As a Plugin Developer

- I want to create local plugins so I can extend Roo Code with custom functionality.
- I want a scaffolding system so I can quickly set up new plugin projects.
- I want my plugin code to hot-reload so I can iterate quickly during development.
- I want to publish my plugins to NPM so others can use them.
- I want clear documentation so I understand how to build compliant plugins.

### As a System Administrator

- I want to control which plugin sources are permitted so I can ensure security.
- I want plugins to run in isolation so they can't crash the main extension.
- I want to see logs of plugin execution so I can troubleshoot issues.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Plugin Definition and Storage

1. **Plugin Manifest:** Store plugin definitions in a `.rooplugins` JSON file in the workspace root.
2. **Plugin Schema:** Define a schema with these required fields:
   - `slug`: Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens)
   - `name`: Human-readable name
   - `location`: Either "local" or "remote"
   - Plus type-specific fields:
     - For remote plugins: `package` (NPM package name)
     - For local plugins: `path` (file path)
3. **Optional Fields:**
   - `roleDefinition`: Description of the plugin's purpose
   - `groups`: Capability categories (e.g., "read", "edit", "command")
   - `customInstructions`: Additional usage instructions
   - `enabled`: Whether the plugin is active (default: true)
4. **Validation:** Ensure all plugin entries conform to the schema.

### 3.2 Plugin Management

1. **Add Plugins:** Allow users to add new plugins via UI or by editing the manifest.
2. **Remove Plugins:** Provide a way to remove plugins from the system.
3. **Enable/Disable:** Toggle plugins on/off without removing them.
4. **Edit Details:** Allow updating a plugin's metadata.
5. **Hot Reload:** Detect changes to the manifest file and update the UI without requiring a restart.

### 3.3 Plugin Execution

1. **Execute Local Plugins:** Run local JavaScript/TypeScript files as Node.js scripts.
2. **Execute Remote Plugins:** Use NPX to run remote plugins from NPM packages.
3. **Execution Sandboxing:** Run each plugin in a separate process for isolation.
4. **Output Capture:** Capture and display plugin execution output.
5. **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle plugin execution errors.
6. **Input Passing:** Optionally allow providing input to plugins.

### 3.4 User Interface

1. **Plugin List:** Show all installed plugins with their status.
2. **Toggle Controls:** Provide an easy way to enable/disable plugins.
3. **Action Buttons:** Include buttons for edit, remove, and run operations.
4. **Add Plugin Form:** Provide a form interface for adding new plugins.
5. **Edit Plugin Form:** Allow editing existing plugin details.
6. **Output Display:** Show plugin execution results in a readable format.
7. **Error Display:** Clearly communicate errors to the user.
8. **Integration:** Integrate with the existing Settings panel in Roo Code.

### 3.5 Developer Experience

1. **Scaffold Local Plugins:** Automatically create starter files for new local plugins.
2. **Code Editor Integration:** Open created plugin files in the editor.
3. **Documentation:** Provide inline guidance and tooltips for plugin creation.
4. **Validation Feedback:** Show clear error messages for invalid plugin definitions.
5. **Hello World Example:** Include a complete example plugin.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance

1. **Startup Speed:** Loading plugins should not significantly impact extension startup time.
2. **Execution Speed:** Plugin execution should be responsive, with appropriate loading indicators.
3. **UI Responsiveness:** The UI should remain responsive during plugin operations.
4. **Resource Usage:** Plugins should have minimal impact on memory and CPU usage.

### 4.2 Reliability

1. **Error Recovery:** Recover gracefully from plugin loading or execution errors.
2. **State Consistency:** Maintain consistent state between UI and config files.
3. **Validation:** Prevent invalid plugin configurations.
4. **Process Isolation:** Ensure plugin failures don't crash the extension.

### 4.3 Security

1. **Process Sandboxing:** Run plugins in separate processes for isolation.
2. **Capability Declarations:** Make plugins declare what capabilities they need.
3. **User Confirmation:** Require confirmation for potentially destructive actions.
4. **Input Validation:** Validate all user input to prevent injection attacks.

### 4.4 Usability

1. **Intuitive Interface:** Design a clear, easy-to-understand UI.
2. **Consistent Patterns:** Follow VS Code's design patterns.
3. **Clear Feedback:** Provide feedback for all user actions.
4. **Internationalization:** Support translation of UI elements.
5. **Accessibility:** Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

### 4.5 Maintainability

1. **Code Organization:** Use a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.
2. **Documentation:** Include comprehensive code documentation.
3. **Testing:** Develop a suite of tests for both backend and UI components.
4. **Extension Points:** Design for future enhancements and additional plugin types.

## 5. Technical Constraints

1. **VS Code API:** Work within the constraints of the VS Code extension API.
2. **Node.js Processes:** Use Node.js child processes for plugin execution.

- Content: Simple script that outputs a greeting
- Manifest entry with all required fields

### 7.2 Remote Plugin Example

Create a simple "Hello World" remote plugin:
