# Memory Bank: Phase 1 - Plugin Manifest Schema

## Summary

We successfully designed and implemented the schema for the Roo Code Plugin System manifest file (`.rooplugins`). This phase focused on defining the data structures, validation rules, and TypeScript interfaces that form the foundation of the plugin system.

## Key Implementations

1. **RooPluginEntry Interface** - Created a TypeScript interface defining the structure of a plugin entry with required and optional fields:
   - Required: `slug`, `name`, `location`
   - Location-specific: `package` (for remote plugins), `path` (for local plugins)
   - Optional: `roleDefinition`, `groups`, `customInstructions`, `enabled`

2. **Zod Schema** - Implemented a Zod validation schema with conditional validation:
   - Base schema for common fields
   - Discriminated union for location-specific fields
   - Runtime validation with detailed error messages
   - Type generation for TypeScript integration

3. **JSON Schema** - Created a JSON Schema for VS Code editor support:
   - Editor IntelliSense and validation
   - Field descriptions and examples
   - Conditional validation using JSON Schema `if/then` rules

## Technical Solutions

1. **Type Safety**
   - Used TypeScript discriminated unions for location-dependent fields
   - Generated TypeScript types from Zod schema for consistency
   - Added JSDoc comments for field descriptions

2. **Validation Strategy**
   - Implemented two-stage validation: TypeScript (compile-time) and Zod (runtime)
   - Used Zod's `superRefine` for complex conditional validation
   - Created separate schemas for remote and local plugins

3. **Schema Design**
   - Designed for future extensibility with optional fields
   - Established consistent naming and structure patterns
   - Created clear validation error messages for user feedback

## Testing Approach

1. **Type Tests** - Validated TypeScript type enforcement:
   - Required fields checking
   - Location-specific field validation
   - TypeScript error checking for invalid configurations

2. **Schema Validation Tests** - Tested Zod schema functionality:
   - Valid entry validation
   - Invalid entry rejection
   - Error message format and clarity
   - Default value application

3. **Integration Tests** - Verified compatibility:
   - JSON Schema and Zod schema equivalent validation
   - Consistent behavior across both validation systems

## Lessons Learned

1. **Schema Design**
   - Creating a schema with conditional requirements requires careful planning
   - Balancing strict validation with flexibility for future extensions
   - Discriminated unions provide excellent type safety for different plugin types

2. **Zod Integration**
   - Zod provides both runtime validation and TypeScript type generation
   - `superRefine` is powerful for complex validation beyond basic types
   - Error messages need to be user-friendly and actionable

3. **JSON Schema Compatibility**
   - JSON Schema and Zod have different validation capabilities
   - JSON Schema requires more verbose syntax for conditional validation
   - Both systems can be aligned to provide consistent validation

## Future Improvements

1. **Versioning** - Add schema version for future compatibility
2. **Extended Validation** - Add deeper validation for package names and paths
3. **Schema Documentation** - Generate schema documentation from code comments
4. **Configuration Section** - Add support for plugin-specific configuration

## Conclusion

The manifest schema phase established a solid foundation for the plugin system by creating type-safe, validated data structures. The schema design balances strict validation with future extensibility, and provides clear feedback for validation errors. This phase successfully sets the stage for the Plugin Manager implementation in Phase 2.
